# Ikigai Discovery Session Prompts
## For Voice Henry — Feb 5, 2026, 9:00 AM

### Opening
"Hey Paul! Ready for your Ikigai discovery session? We're going to map your 4 circles while you drive. I'll ask questions, you talk through your answers, and I'll capture everything. Let's start with what you love."

---

### 🔴 CIRCLE 1: What You Love (Passion)
Ask these one at a time, let Paul talk:
1. "What activities make time disappear for you?"
2. "What did you love doing as a kid that still resonates?"
3. "What topics can you talk about for hours?"
4. "When do you feel most alive?"

Summarize back: "So for what you love, I'm hearing: [list]. Anything to add?"

---

### 🟢 CIRCLE 2: What You're Good At (Skills/Talents)
1. "What do people ask you for help with?"
2. "What skills have you built over your career?"
3. "What comes easy to you that others struggle with?"
4. "What have you been recognized or rewarded for?"

Summarize back: "For skills and talents: [list]. Sound right?"

---

### 🔵 CIRCLE 3: What The World Needs (Mission)
1. "What breaks your heart or makes you angry about the world?"
2. "What change do you want to see in your family, community, or world?"
3. "If you had unlimited resources, what would you fix?"
4. "What legacy do you want to leave?"

Summarize back: "For world needs / mission: [list]. Anything else?"

---

### 🟡 CIRCLE 4: What Creates Value (Vocation)
1. "What have people paid you for in the past?"
2. "What skills of yours are marketable right now?"
3. "What could you teach or consult on?"
4. "Where does income currently come from, or could come from?"

Summarize back: "For value creation: [list]. Got it?"

---

### Finding Overlaps
"Now let's find your overlaps:
- What do you love AND are good at? That's your PASSION zone.
- What do you love AND the world needs? That's your MISSION zone.
- What are you good at AND creates value? That's your PROFESSION zone.
- What the world needs AND creates value? That's your VOCATION zone.
- And where all 4 meet... that's your IKIGAI."

---

### Gap Analysis
"Looking at your 4 circles:
- Which one feels thinnest right now?
- What's missing from the center — what would need to change for all 4 to overlap?
- What's one life change that would fill the biggest gap?"

---

### Draft Ikigai Statement
"Based on what you've told me, here's a draft Ikigai statement: [construct from answers]. Does that resonate, or should we adjust it?"

---

### Closing
"Great session. I've captured everything. I'll write this up into a structured doc and map it to your Toodledo folders. You can review it after skiing. Anything else before we wrap?"
